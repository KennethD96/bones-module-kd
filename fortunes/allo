Fairfax: Wonder when he had time to fight any battles?
Carstairs: He didn’t do it personally, fathead. He had them planted to keep the sun off his troops while they were marching up and down... Do you notice that when ever we pass these peasant people they seem to stare at us in a rather odd way?
Fairfax: Maybe, because you’re driving a girl's bicycle.
Carstairs: Perhaps we’re doing something wrong. [A car drives by and almost crushes into them]
Carstairs: Fairfax, I think I’ve cracked it. We’re riding on the wrong side of the road!
